## Handling sensitive data at NAISS 

**Time**: 9:00 - 12:00 and 13:00 - 16:00

Are you just beginning to work with sensitive data in your research? If yes, welcome to a 1-day introduction to handling sensitive data at NAISS systems. Bianca is the only resource so far and will be used during this instance of the course

We will tell you about NAISS-SENS, how to login to Bianca, transfer files via wharf, basics of the SLURM workload manager and the module system on sensitive systems. We may also, if time allows, cover how to start IDEs, like RStudio and Jupyter-lab.


### Prerequisites 

- Basic Linux (as in the "Linux Command Line 101" module of this training week). 

### Topics 

- an overview of kinds of sensitive data
- how to login
- how the sensitive system is set up
- how you transfer your data in/out from the sensitive systems
- how you get access to the software you need at this system
- how you use the job scheduler to run on the compute nodes
- (how to start IDEs)
