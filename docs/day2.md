## Selecting software modules 

**Time**: 9:00 - 12:00 

The course will show you how to find and load modules. While the modules may be somewhat differently named and have somewhat different versions depending on the center you are working, the procedure and commands are the same. 

### Prerequisites 

- Basic Linux (like in the "Linux Command Line 101" module for instance)

### Topics 

- What is the module system?
- Why do I want to use the module system?
- What happens when I load/unload modules?
    - paths
    - environment variables
    - more?
- What is EasyBuild?
- Useful commands
- Load examples
- Compiler toolchains
