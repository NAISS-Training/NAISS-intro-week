# Selecting software modules  

**Time**: 9:00 - 11:30 

The course will show you how to find and access your require software on NAISS systems.  For NAISS systems, utilised by several hundret users simultanously, organising software in a module system is essential.  This ensures that every user can get access to their required software, including the desired version.  The module system also ensures that there are no conflicts between the software titles and the software requirements of other users.  

While the modules may be somewhat differently named on the individual systems, the procedure and commands are the same.
