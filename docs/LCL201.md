This course teaches you to work smarter from a command line.

In this 6-hour, 2-day online workshop you will learn how to work smarter using different Bash commands, Bash scripting and some quality of life topics. You can follow either day or both.

NOTE: You can run on your own (Linux) computer or on your favorite HPC cluster (that you already have access to).

At the end of each day, you should feel able to work smarter and able to avoid more grunt work (i.e. anything that involves repeated copypaste). 

## Prerequisites
