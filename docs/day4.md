# Day 4 

**Date**: 
**Time**: 9:00 - 12:00

## Running AI/ML workloads on NAISS systems 

**Time**: 9:00 - 12:00

This session will introduce you to what is different when doing machine
learning on a compute cluster. Performance considerations and best practices.

Code examples will focus on PyTorch and TensorFlow as framework, but also other
utilities.

The main relevant NAISS resources is Alvis this first time and later Arrhenius
GPU partition when that is in place.

### Prerequisites
- [Connecting](day1.md) to an HPC cluster
- [Selecting software modules](day2.md)
- [Running jobs on a cluster](day2.md)
- A basic understanding of machine learning
