# Running AI/ML workloads on NAISS systems 

**Time**: 9:00 - 12:00

This session will introduce you to what is different when doing machine
learning on a compute cluster. Performance considerations and best practices.

Code examples will focus on PyTorch and TensorFlow as framework, but also other
utilities.

The main relevant NAISS resources is Alvis this first time and later Arrhenius
GPU partition when that is in place.

## Prerequisites

To be able to follow along you should have a basic understanding of machine
learning and know how to:

- [Connect](connecting.md) to an HPC cluster
- Use software on an HPC cluster with [modules](modules.md) and/or Apptainer containers
- [Run jobs on a cluster](slurm.md)
- Program in Python
