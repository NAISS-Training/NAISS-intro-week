It aims to give a brief, but comprehensive introduction to the Linux operating system. It is meant for beginners to the Linux operating system. Prerequisites \u00b6 You need access to a Linux system. You can use your own computer or any other computer (including computing access at computing centers) you have access to and that runs Linux. Topics \u00b6 What is Linux and why should I use it? You will learn about the command line interface (CLI) navigating and modifying the file tree ls mkdir cd mv editors on the Linux system pipes, sorting, filters redirection pipes etc. patterns scripting some handy hints and tricks This course will consist of lectures and type-alongs, as well as a few exercises where you get to try out what you have just learned. Note Link to the course material: Linux Command Line 101 . Connecting and File transfers \u00b6 Time : 13:00 - 16:00 This course will teach you how to login to and transfer files between NAISS HPC clusters.
