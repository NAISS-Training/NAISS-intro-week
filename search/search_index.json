The NAISS introduction training week is aimed at new users of the infrastructure. More experienced users, wishing to deepen their understanding of the workings of the systems, are more than welcome to attend our event. We offer seven modules distributed over 5 days. Each module describes are particular aspect of using a NAISS system. You are welcome to choose and pick the modules that best address your existing knowledge, your interest and your requirements. For each module we provide a separate description, which should allow you to make an informed choice on the modules you wish to attend. The training is open for all current and prospective users of the NAISS infrastucture. Each module covers 3 or 6 hours. The modules are delivered in English and are held online. DAY 1: 2nd February 2026 \u00b6 Linux Command Line 101 (3 hours) Connecting and File Transfer (3 hours) DAY 2: 3rd February 2026 \u00b6 On day 2 there are two separate modules. In the morning we will be discussing the module system, which is required to access most of the software, and how it is used to select the software you require. In the afternoon, we will be discussing how to actually run jobs on a NAISS system, using the job scheduler. As part of the afternoon module we also discuss the basic architecture of a typical HPC cluster.

For NAISS systems, utilised by several hundret users simultanously, organising software in a module system is essential. This ensures that every user can get access to their required software, including the desired version. The module system also ensures that there are no conflicts between the software titles and the software requirements of other users.

We may also, if time allows, cover how to start IDEs, like RStudio and Jupyter-lab.","title":"Handling sensitive data at NAISS"},{"location":"day5/#prerequisites","text":"Basic Linux (as in the \u201cLinux Command Line 101\u201d module of this training week).","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"day5/#topics","text":"an overview of kinds of sensitive data how to login how the sensitive system is set up how you transfer your data in/out from the sensitive systems how you get access to the software you need at this system how you use the job scheduler to run on the compute nodes (how to start IDEs) Note Link to the course material: Bianca intro .","title":"Topics"},{"location":"intro/","text":"NAISS introduction week \u00b6 Welcome to the NAISS introduction week.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"intro/#naiss__introduction__week","text":"Welcome to the NAISS introduction week.","title":"NAISS introduction week"},{"location":"modules/","text":"Selecting software modules \u00b6 Time : 9:00 - 11:30 The course will show you how to find and access your require software on NAISS systems. For NAISS systems, utilised by several hundret users simultanously, organising software in a module system is essential. This ensures that every user can get access to their required software, including the desired version. The module system also ensures that there are no conflicts between the software titles and the software requirements of other users. While the modules may be somewhat differently named on the individual systems, the procedure and commands are the same. Note Click the Home (at the top) to see the date.
